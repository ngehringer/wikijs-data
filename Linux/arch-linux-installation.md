# Arch Linux Installation

In the process of installing arch linux as my secondary system on my main computer, I am documenting every caveat and specifics that caused issues.
Installing arch (with secure boot) is not an easy process and mistakes can easily be made. The specifics here mainly apply on my use case but can be useful for anyone wanting to install Arch on their own.
